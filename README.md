# Example-with-TDAstats

This consists of an R markdown file that compares the performance of TDA and TDAstats packages in computing persistent homology for a selection of about 30 stocks over two timeperiods. It's intended to be self-contained in that the user downloads the stock data using the BatchGetSymbols package.

This is a quick example put together in January 2019, focusing on the R packages rather than mathematical or financial explanation. I'll include a link to more pedagogical material if desired.
